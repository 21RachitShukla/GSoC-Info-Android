      "description": "[52Â°North](http://52north.org) is an international research and development partner network with partners from academia, the public sector and industry. Our goal is to foster innovation in the field of geoinformatics by organizing and facilitating a collaborative software development process. The topics we address comprise for example sensor web technologies, web-based geoprocessing the web of things, linked open data, spatial data infrastructures, citizen science, earth observation, and 3D. This selection of topics reflects both the strengths and strategies of the partners involved.\n\nSome of our software projects are enviroCar, 52Â°North SOS, 52Â°North Helgoland (JavaScript Sensor Web Client), ILWIS, and 52Â°North WPS. Check out our GitHub organization and our Open Hub page to learn more about the wide range of software our communities work on: from mobile apps to standardized web services, from cutting edge research to established products. 52Â°North open source projects are used in a broad range of domains (e.g. oceanology, air quality, hydrology, traffic planning) and operational as well as research projects (e.g. European Horizon 2020 projects such as NeXOS, FixO3, ConnectinGEO, WaterInnEU, ODIP 2, SeaDataCloud).\n\nAll of the 52Â°North software is published under an OSI approved open source license.\n\n52Â°North GmbH, which is the legal body and service center of the network, acts as a non-profit organization. This means that the shareholders of 52Â°North do not receive profit shares or payments from company funds. Instead, the profits earned by 52Â°North are completely re-invested into the innovation and software development process.",

The server management  is done through a friendly user interface (the \"platformâ€\u009d). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.\n\nThe installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR \"engine\") and some are very popular open source apps and services.",

Here are the main tips to help you when writing your GSOC application with Apertium.\r\n\r\n- Be realistic: We're more likely to accept realistic ideas than far-out wacky ones. But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform â€” ideally before, or in the community bonding period â€” and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page! If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page. Read the ideas page. \r\n\r\n1. http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Top_tips_for_GSOC_applications",

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Paradigm\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engineâ€™s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by FranÃ§ois Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.",

      "description": "Babel helps you write the latest version of JavaScript, and is helping shape the future of the language itself. It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and hundreds of other [companies](http://babeljs.io/users). It's downloaded more than [8 million times a month](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core) on npm.\n\nWhen your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.\n\nIn short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.\n\n### Transition to Natively Support JavaScript\n\nBabel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.\n\nFor example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 2); // arrow functions!\n```\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(function (a) { // compiled to a regular function expression\n  return a+2;\n});\n```\n\nEfforts like https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env means you can take advantage of the native browser support when possible.\n\nPlease read the tips below on how to get started and how to create a successful proposal!",

Our currently hosted projects include the Elixir programming language, Disco, a distributed computing framework originated from Nokia, ejabberd, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others.

      "description": "# The IDEs of Python\nPython has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.",

After as an absolute minimum reading all posts tagged **[gsoc16]**, students should write a well researched and intelligent message with **[gsoc16]** at the front of the subject line to that developer's mailing list seeking a mentor, and be as flexible as possible in finding a topic that both they and the mentor is interested in upon which to base a GSoC project proposal text to be submitted to Google.\n As a general rule, a well written and researched proposal to extend or improve an existing mature Boost library is likely to be much better received that student originated ideas for new libraries or facilities.\n4. Once a potential mentor and project idea is found, the student must write a project proposal which should follow [this submission template](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/SoCSubmissionTemplate).",

      "description": "Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach our ultimate goal, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networking. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system, which we expect to deploy in production by the end of 2017. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nOur previous GSoC students have taken advantage of the advanced knowledge they acquired to go on to graduate schools, to become some of our GSoC mentors, and to continue supporting free software. Pursuing GSoC with the Linux XIA team at BU could be a great way for you to acquire advanced skills and build connections towards a strong application to the Masters or Ph.D. program at the Computer Science department of Boston University.\n\nThe projects in our ideas list cater to students who are proficient in C programming and comfortable with advanced data structures.",

      "description": "The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app â€œPocket Codeâ€\u009d is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a â€œLego-likeâ€\u009d style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. Thatâ€™s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.",

It provides a unique userÂ\u00ad-friendly and \"biologyÂ\u00ad-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\n# Who is using cBioPortal? \nThe [public instance of cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 3,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal ([Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract) & [Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210)) have been cited more than 1,900 and 1,400 times, respectively, since their publication. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe. Notably, cBioPortal has been adopted as the analysis and visualization platform by [AACR GENIE](http://blog.aacr.org/aacr-project-genie-the-sharing-economy-comes-to-the-clinic/), an international multi-institutional data-sharing project to catalyze precision oncology. \n\n# Who are we?\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing â€œbig dataâ€\u009d of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/), [the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/), [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/), [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](http://www.chop.edu/), and [The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands](http://thehyve.nl/).",

      "description": "CERN-HSF (High Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the worldâ€™s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.",

      "description": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.\nWe have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the\n[Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time,\nbefore they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of\n_pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count =\n\"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html#get-started).",

      "description": "Due to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world â€“ from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China â€“ consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs.\n\nWe have developed the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it will revolutionize the study of the ancient world. It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500). As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has versionâ€“controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With preâ€“trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easyâ€“toâ€“use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.",

What follows is a highâ€“level overview of these projects and a few tips in applying. Most work will be done in the Python and JavaScript languages, of which a beginner's or intermediate knowledge is expected.\n\nIf you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See the Projects page on the wiki for ideas of what a good application will include. See also [the CLTK docs](http://docs.cltk.org) for what we can already do for a given language.\n\nThe other family of tasks regards the CLTK's inâ€“development website, the Classical Language Archive ([in Meteor and React](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_frontend)) and API ([in Python's Flask framework](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_api_v2)). See our description of the frontend, experiment with the live demo, and explain in your application which functionality you would most like to see added, why, and how you will do so over the course of three months.\n\nThe CLTK's GSoC mentors may not be able to reply to all enquiries, however the best way to ensure a good response is to submit, as early as possible, a draft application essay, in which you explain the resources you will use, the order in which you will do your work, and a timeline.

      "description": "The Computational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics Research Group of the University of Antwerp (CLiPS, http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be) focuses on applications of statistical and machine learning methods, trained on corpus data, to explain human language acquisition and processing data, and to develop automatic text analysis systems that are accurate, efficient, and robust enough to be used in practical applications.\n\nThere are 3 subgroups to CLiPS: (1) the sociolinguistics group studies language variation in different demographic groups. The (2) psycholinguists research the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on the (3) computational linguistics subgroup.\n\nCurrent research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of  personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.\n\nOver the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.",

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n\nClojure, as a GSoC mentoring organization, includes projects from all parts of the Clojure ecosystem, from IDE tooling to logic programming libraries.",

      "description": "CloudCV is a young open source cloud platform  started in 2013 by students and faculty from Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Virginia Tech (now at Georgia Tech) with the aim to make AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldnâ€™t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldnâ€™t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis.",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

      "description": "Conversations.im originally started out as an easy to use Jabber/XMPP client for the Android platform specifically targeted at end users and people who are new to XMPP. To achieve this end, a big priority of the project is great UX. Being an XMPP client, Conversations aims to be fully compatible with XMPP clients on other platforms such as Gajim on Window & Linux as well as ChatSecure on iOS.\n\nThe Conversations project is very involved in driving progress in the XMPP-based instant messaging sphere. We make use of bleeding-edge protocol extensions where available, but more than that, we are also actively developing novel approaches to yet unsolved problems. We are not afraid to try new things and our active community is always willing to try out prototype implementations. Furthermore, members of the Conversations team are also part of the XMPP Standards Foundation to standardize newly developed approaches for modern, mobile friendly XMPP.\nOne very successful example of such innovation is OMEMO encryption, which is now supported by 5+ popular XMPP clients and was originally developed for Conversations as a GSoC project.\n\nOver time, the Conversations project also developed various tools to make life easier for end users and also make the XMPP world more approachable for new comers. For example we developed the XMPP Compliance Tester that tests public servers for compatibility with the latest XMPP extensions to help users [pick a good server](https://gultsch.de/compliance_ranked.html).",

It is interlinked to many other datasets. The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called *Linked Data*, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.\n\n# The Web of data\nSuch *Web of data* provides useful knowledge that can complement the *Web of documents* in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010 website* by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *disambiguation*). For example, `Washington` can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.\n\n# We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

We put a trash can on every street corner with a simple, low-friction flagging system. Positive behaviors are encouraged through likes and badges. We gently, constantly educate members in a just-in-time manner on the universal rules of civilized discourse.\n\n### Uncompromisingly open source.\n\nThere is only one version of Discourse â€“ the awesome open source version. Thereâ€™s no super secret special paid commercial version with better or more complete features. Because Discourse is 100% open source, now and forever, it belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. Thatâ€™s how community works.\n\nEverything that most communities would want is included out of the box; a giant collection of complex plugins should not be required to have a great experience.\n\n### Further reading:\n\n- https://www.discourse.org/faq/\n- http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/\n- https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/\n- https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/\n- https://meta.discourse.org/",

Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems.

      "description": "Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.\n\nThe overall goal is to combine:\n\n  - A devotion to communication, design, and user experience.\n  - Strong theoretical foundations.\n\nExamples of these goals in practice include the following.\n\n\n# No Runtime Exceptions\n\nUnlike hand-written JavaScript, Elm code does not produce runtime exceptions in practice. Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give [friendly hints](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants). This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 90k+ lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.\n\n# Great Performance\n\nElm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and [the benchmarks](http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two) show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.\n\n# Enforced Semantic Versioning\n\nElm can detect all API changes automatically thanks to its type system. We use that information to force everything in [our package catalog](http://package.elm-lang.org) to follow [semantic versioning](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/#version-rules) precisely. No more surprises in PATCH releases!",

      "description": "**Open Monitoring, Documenting, and Responding to the Removal of Environmental Data**\n\nThe Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) leverages research and online tools to monitor, document, and respond to the anticipated undermining of evidence-based environmental governance. EDGI is committed to tracking changes to US federal environmental management and governance, in a range of agencies including EPA, NOAA, NASA, USGS, OSHA, DoE and BLM, among many others.\n\nEDGI brings together North American social scientists, environmental and physical scientists, lawyers, and other information and environmental professionals to document and advocate for the vital importance of evidence-based environmental policy. Through three core working groups EDGI analyzes changes to federal agencies' 1) funding and regulation, 2) personnel and research and 3) **public data**.\n\nThrough the third working group, EDGI has been a leading partner in the international effort to preserve and track federal environmental data, and support environmental scientists, non-profit organizations, and foundations by making this data publicly available. We are also indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work. We need deep thinkers to develop protocols for the resilient, sustainable, accessible, distributed data storage networks of the future; machine learning experts to sift through millions of web pages to find the most important changes; and security specialists to protect the privacy of our volunteers and ensure the integrity of our data. We believe this work is essential to preserving the integrity of scientific research in the US, and also builds a new level of transparency and government accountability to citizens.",

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nOur goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](http://www.librecores.org).\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a [few ideas](http://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc17-ideas.html), and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Hebden Bridge, UK, on September 8-10.",

      "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.",

      "description": "Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome, in 2001, to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.",

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you donâ€™t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Donâ€™t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesnâ€™t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\n\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

      "description": "GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.\n\nOctave is continually being upgraded. The current version 4.2 includes a graphical user interface, support for classdef object-oriented programming, and many new and improved functions. Student projects may also involve developing or upgrading Octave Forge packages, which can be loaded to provide additional specialized functions that supplement those provided in Core Octave.",

The aim of the project is to provide various tools for electric vehicles. There are two sides to the project:\n\n## For Drivers\n\nOn one side, we want to provide drivers of electric vehicles with practical solutions, that is, with optimal driving direction for their route. For that we are developing a platform independent navigation system.\n\n## For Scientists\n\nOn the other side, we want to develop tools for scientifically analyzing algorithmic solutions. For that we are developing tools for visualization of algorithms, for comparing their performance, we want to provide a generic API for custom algorithms and a lot more.\n\n## Ideas\n\nInstead of working towards a specific electric vehicel, we want to leverage machine learning to derive the parameters automatically, getting better with every route.",

      "description": "Haiku is an open source operating system currently in development. Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhatâ€™s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==============================\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\n- Specific focus on personal computing\n- Custom kernel designed for responsiveness\n- Fully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\n- Rich OO API for faster development\n- Database-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\n- Unified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==========\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n=================\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

We bring together a passionate community of developers and a growing base of commercial participants (Delphix, Joyent, Nexenta, OmniTI, and others).\n\nillumos is the successor to Sun Microsystems' OpenSolaris project. Our culture draws heavily on the qualities that distinguished Sun engineering culture: systems engineering (component, interaction, and interface design with a strong commitment to minimalism), architectural coherence (design cooperation across subsystems), measurement-driven development (strong visibility tools, mature methodologies for their use, embedding both thoroughly in the development process). We have adapted it to work beyond the framework of a single corporate entity via federated efforts of individuals and companies with distinct interests in the technology (cloud infrastructure, storage systems, application servers, and others), sharing an interest in commodity hardware and production-driven innovation.\n\nillumos features an unparalleled combination of technologies, including the resilient ZFS storage system, production-safe dynamic tracing (DTrace), FMA predictive self-healing, the Service Management Framework for persistent process and boot management, zones for lightweight isolation and virtualisation, the KVM hypervisor for full system virtualisation, Crossbow for virtualised networks, a high-performance kernel CIFS/SMB client and server, boot environments for safe upgrades, and the MDB kernel and application debugger. All of these subsystems are actively developed by the illumos project. Both ZFS and DTrace have been ported beyond illumos (notably to FreeBSD, OS X, and Linux), where our community and sister OpenZFS community have taken a leading role in coordinating new feature development across platforms, serving as a reference platform and repository",

The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parametrizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.",

      "description": "JdeRobot is a software development suite for robotics, computer vision and  home-automation applications. These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. It is written in C++ and Python, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.\n\nReal robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.\n\nGetting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor or the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior. \n\nJdeRobot include several tools: robot teleoperators, a tuner for color filters, a tool for visual creation of automata (Finite State Machine) that control robot behavior, etc. The web browsers also may be used to directly connect to the robots, their sensors and actuators.\n \nIncludes a framework for teaching robotics [ http://jderobot.org/Teaching_robotics_with_JdeRobot ]. Several exercises have been developed: for visual control of a Formula1, autonomous navigation of a taxi inside a city, drone rescue missions, computer vision, etc.",

      "description": "Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio / video calls con the desktop.\n\nThe Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects:\n\nJitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)\n\nJitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)\n\nJitsi (desktop) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP/Jabber, AIM/ICQ, Yahoo!, and Bonjour. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. \n\nlibjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)\n \nice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)\n\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\n\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.",

      "description": "LabLua is a research lab at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), affiliated with its Computer Science Department. It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n \n## What is Lua?\n[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n## What is CÃ©u?\n[CÃ©u](http://www.ceu-lang.org/) provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it.  CÃ©u can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.",

Getting in touch first is especially recommended if you are planning to apply to work on an original idea, rather than one of our suggestions. To introduce yourself, discuss ideas or your application, feel free to join us at our lab's [GSoC mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/labluagsoc). Our mentors will make sure to establish a friendly and respectful channel of communication with you.\n\n## Am I experienced enough?\nCheck out the difficulty level on each proposed project. All projects are designed to fit the length of GSoC, given the student's suitable level of experience: a project marked Easy may be taken by an early-stage undergraduate, while a project marked Hard might be more appropriate for a graduate student, or a particularly experienced undergraduate. We will take this into consideration when matching students to projects.\n\n## Application questionnaire\nReady? Use our [GSoC Application Questionnaire](http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/apply2017.html) as a template for your application, filling in all the answers!",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like MicrosoftÂ® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. \n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.",

Changes in behavior, new SQL commands, etc. Do not talk about function names, algorithms or data structures here.\n* _How do you want to do it?_ Here you should describe your project in term of internals, function names, algorithms and data structures. What do you want to change and how. Try to show that you know what you're talking about and not simply copied from the project ideas page\n* _When do you plan to do what?_ Present the timeline here. What will be ready when? Structure your work so that you could test new code immediately, implement your project in small steps that could be tested incrementally. Reserve at least 40% of the time for testing.\n\nNote, you will almost certainly write a better proposal and will improve your chance of being accepted if you'll discuss your project first on the mailing list or the irc.\n\nAfter you've filed the proposal, you might receive a reply from a mentor with a test assignment.

      "description": "# What is Matrix?\nMatrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n# What is Matrixâ€™s Mission?\nMatrixâ€™s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n# What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n# How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to exiting services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with libpurple or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nWe have recently added end-to-end encryption to Matrix. Find out all about it in the recordings of our talks at FOSDEM '17:  \n * [Encrypting Matrix](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/)\n *  [The future of decentralised communication](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/)",

      "description": "Microkernels are operating systems that outsource the traditional operating system functionality to ordinary user processes while providing them with mechanisms requisite for implementing it. Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches. Some of the most often cited reasons for structuring the system as a microkernel is flexibility, security and fault tolerance. Many microkernels can take on the role of a hypervisor, too. Microkernels and their user environments are most often implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages (such as Rust) are possible, too. In fact, each component of a microkernel-based system can be implemented in a different programming language.\n\nWe are the collective body representing [Genode](http://genode.org/), [HelenOS](http://www.helenos.org/), [GNU Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/), [MINIX 3](http://www.minix3.org/) and [Redox](https://www.redox-os.org/) microkernel-based operating systems. Our cooperation dates back to 2012 when we first met at the [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/) conference in Brussels and organized the first track (a.k.a. a devroom) entirely dedicated to microkernels and related technologies. The [Microkernel devroom](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/) has since become a de facto institutionalized feature of each FOSDEM. Now we also take part in the Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization in order to function as an umbrella for our respective member projects.",

Ideas listed on our ideas page already have mentors who are able and willing to mentor them.\n\nThe ideas in our ideas page are starting points; do not simply copy and paste them. Your proposal is a pitch for why we should spend our time and energy mentoring you over the summer. Use this opportunity to demonstrate your enthusiasm, your understanding of the topic and your ability to research and plan.\n\nYour proposal should explain why you are interested in the idea/project, your plan to implement it, and any relevant background experience. You must also state that this project will be your primary project for the Summer of Code period and you will not have any concurrent internships or other work. Examples of existing open-source contributions, such as links to pull requests you have made, are helpful, but not required.\n\nGood luck!",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n## Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

Software commonly associated with netfilter.org is iptables.\n\nSoftware inside this framework enables packet filtering, network address [and port] translation (NA[P]T) and other packet mangling. It is the re-designed and heavily improved successor of the previous Linux 2.2.x ipchains and Linux 2.0.x ipfwadm systems.\n\nnetfilter is a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.\n\niptables is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets. Each rule within an IP table consists of a number of classifiers (iptables matches) and one connected action (iptables target).\n\nnetfilter, ip_tables, connection tracking (ip_conntrack, nf_conntrack) and the NAT subsystem together build the major parts of the framework.",

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).",

Users of ODK software include Red Cross, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control, Jane Goodall Institute, Gates Foundation, the Carter Center, and many others.\n\nThe ODK ecosystem has several interoperable tools that are used to collect data. For GSoC, we will focus on the Android client ([ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect)), the form builder ([ODK Build](https://github.com/opendatakit/build)), and the desktop downloader ([ODK Briefcase](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase)). These tools are used in the deployments below. \n\n**Contribute and make the world a better place!**\n* Hutan Aceh in Indonesia is home to tigers, elephants, orangutans and rhinos. EIA International and local activists protect it by documenting forest crimes with ODK. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/109241884).\n* Evaluating global health programs involves collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. Population Council, Marie Stopes Uganda, and Gobee Group use ODK to streamline the process. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/38123850).\n* The Jane Goodall Institute uses ODK to empower local communities to better manage and monitor their forests. ODK lets these communities connect directly with the global carbon marketplace and demonstrate the concrete benefits of their efforts to protect the forest. [Watch video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8). \n* The Carter Center uses ODK to get the real-time data needed to assess elections. Over the last six years, ODK has been used to monitor elections in Liberia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Nepal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Tunisia. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-CGzo3m4PA).\n* For governments working to end polio, access to accurate and timely information makes a world of difference. ODK is used in Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and South Sudan as a key tool in mass polio vaccination campaign quality control. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zROyvrvt-zk).",

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/)). The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast a solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpen Astronomy currently is formed by [eight organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects on astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code; \n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets;\n- ChiantiPy is a Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database, which allows users to characterise the properties (temperature, density, velocity) of observed stars from spectra; \n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia. \n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

      "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

If you want to follow a template, this one is a good starting point:\n\n**Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. Whatâ€™s the current state of things? Whatâ€™s the issue you wish to solve and why? This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\n**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.",

      "description": "In the summer of 2008 the [Metropolitan City of Rome](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/) decided to start a **free of charge and public Wi-Fi network** to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy â€“ typical of open projects â€“ anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.",

      "description": "# Why Oppia?\nProviding personalized tutoring to every single person in the world. This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community aspect of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.\n\n# How does PEcAn do that? #\n\nPEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.",

These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.\n\nPCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n###### PCP Collectors\nThese are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n###### PCP Monitors\nThese are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be  executing remotely.  On  the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain, while also being fun and simple to use every day.\n\n## Why choose phpBB?\nOriginally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), user groups, an extendable permissions system, hierarchical subforums, file attachments, a variety of notification options (E-Mail, Jabber, ATOM feeds), OAuth authentication, Emojis, and a variety of other features as well as support for PHP 7 and 7.1. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.\n\nOur strict security practices have resulted in a solid product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.\n\n## phpBB and Google Summer of Code\nWe are proud to have previously participated in the GSoC program three times with great success. Former phpBB GSoC student have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team. We hope that you will help us continue this excellent trend.",

People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.\n\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isnâ€™t realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isnâ€™t about replacing native apps: itâ€™s about enabling interaction when native apps just arenâ€™t practical.\n\nThe Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of Physical Web software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.",

For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\n\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 7 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\n\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, Swift and Salesforce.com Apex.\n\n# Usage\n\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.",

      "description": "PostgreSQL's architecture has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.  An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.  There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 30 terabytes of data.  \nPostgreSQL has won praise from its users and industry recognition, including the Linux New Media Award for Best Database System and five time winner of the The Linux Journal Editors' Choice Award for best DBMS.",

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

It features a testsuite that aims to cover as many cases as possible in order to catch regressions.\n\nRadare2 is composed of a hexadecimal editor at its core, with support for several architectures and binary formats. It features code analysis capabilities, scripting, data and code visualization through graphs and  other means, a visual mode, easy unix integration, a binary diffing engine for code and data, a shellcode compiler, and much, much more!",

Though you can also choose any of the GitHub issues for radare2 if they are big enough to be a qualification task, still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nSteps to start the application\n\n  - Read Google's instructions for participating\n  - Grab any project from the [list of ideas](http://radare.org/gsoc/2017/ideas.html) that you're interested in (or propose your own)\n  - Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and [our template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDPGgr_D5tQuYLQi_gEGlkuQ-DlU8GH5kDBqZbVSC7I/edit?usp=sharing) and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you\n  - Submit it using Google's web interface\n\nHow to fill in the application template\n\n  - Keep it simple enough to fit on no more than a couple of pages. Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early\n - You can also choose a â€œbackupâ€\u009d idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.",

      "description": "Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\n\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\n\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\n\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.",

SciRuby consists of a [fairly large number of gems](https://goo.gl/uWnVub), including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, rubex, and NMatrix.\n\nNMatrix [has been awarded grants](https://goo.gl/zSycrJ) by the [Ruby Association](https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T) in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. Statsample and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while daru, nyaplot and gnuplotrb take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY), and Rubex and tensorflow.rb [received it in 2016](https://goo.gl/QNiMq9).\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. In fact, all the grants issued in 2016 by the Ruby Association (which is headed by Matz) have gone to scientific projects.\n\nSince we are first and foremost a science-related project, we expect successful student projects to lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research.",

From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to â€œmixâ€\u009d elements from different sets for calculations.

At the root, the languageâ€™s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Javaâ€™s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: â€œWeâ€™ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. Itâ€™s reinvigorated the team.â€\u009d",

      "description": "Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.",

Based on that, we will ask you a realistic planning for the 12 weeks of GSoC, including the deliverables expected at mid-term and at the end of the GSoC. In order to be complete, we also expect you to make a pull request, for example for a bug fix. The purpose is to ensure you know how to use Git, and that you had a look at our coding conventions.\n\nWe don't expect you to produce a perfect application without any help at all. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plans and your application with us while you're preparing it, to ensure your ideas align well with our own thoughts on the tasks, and that your objectives are achievable. It is also the perfect chance to already get to know your potential mentors and the rest of the team.

      "description": "Our Mission\n\nDevelop and promote adoption of a specification to enable any party in a software supply chain, from the original author to the final end user, to accurately communicate the licensing information for any piece of copyrightable material that such party may create, alter, combine, pass on, or receive, and to make such information available in a consistent, understandable, and re-usable fashion, with the aim of facilitating license and other policy compliance.\n\nOur Vision\n\nThe vision of SPDX is achieve license compliance with minimal cost across the supply chain. Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.\n\nExecution\n\nDevelopment of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.\n\nThe SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site. Most of that is embodied in the spec itself, but we have developed a number of separate assets that complement the specification, including a standard license list, implementation guidelines and the SPDX compatible tools.",

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.\n\nIf you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC research, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check out our [ideas page](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas) and contact us either though the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) or via an email at <hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu>",

TEAMMATES took part in GSoCs 2014, 2015, and 2016 as a mentoring organization.\nThe long-term vision of TEAMMATES is to become the biggest student-built project in the world. So far,  it has **received contributions of [200+ student developers](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/about.jsp)** and have done **more than 200 [releases](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/milestones?direction=desc&sort=due_date&state=closed)** over a six year period. \nBecause one of the main aims of TEAMMATES (the project) is to train students in contributing to non-trivial OSS productions system, it is well-designed, well-documented, and well-tested (we have a very high level of automated testing).The product uses several emerging technologies (e.g., Google App Engine) learning of which will benefit students. Because TEAMMATES (the product) is a software for students by students, students can relate to the problem domain better. The scale of the system is big enough (~150 KLoC) without being overwhelming. \n\nProject led by faculty member [Damith C.

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

      "description": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, SÃ£o Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.\n\nYou can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://jpf.byu.edu/gsoc17/projects/projects.html) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it.

      "description": "Julia is a fast and flexible language for technical computing. While young among programming languages, at just over five years since its public release, it's rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around 150,000 users (and growing) have together built over 1300 packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. You can learn more about Juliaâ€™s features at http://julialang.org/.\n\nCompared to more established languages, Julia's package library is small and still coming of age â€“ but for you, that's a great opportunity! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great way not only to build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different! If that sounds interesting to you, please send an application, or reach out to us at https://discourse.julialang.org/ with any questions.",

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.  The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our [web site](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/), but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of _ns-3_ is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.  We operate as an GPLv2 open source project with an associated consortium and steering committee to provide administrative support to the project.",

The Foundationâ€™s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields â€” and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We wish to develop a system where everyone has the ability to record presentations and host live remote participants across the globe.\n\nOur projects include simple web development, to real time live video mixing software, to hardware and electronics! One of our biggest projects is the [HDMI2USB.tv project](https://hdmi2usb.tv).\n\n## HDMI2USB.tv: Open video capture hardware + firmware\n\nThe HDMI2USB project develops affordable hardware options to record and stream HD videos (from HDMI & DisplayPort sources) for conferences, meetings and user groups.\n\nWe are currently developing our own hardware (the [Numato Opsis](https://hdmi2usb.tv/numato-opsis/)), and also [provide firmware](https://hdmi2usb.tv/firmware/) for various prototyping boards.\n\nHDMI2USB started in 2013, and is an active ongoing project in its third iteration of hardware prototyping. Today you can download working firmware and have real capture happen. Get involved in contributing code both to the capture software + FPGA stack\n\nOur aim is this becomes the defacto, incredibly affordable and easy to use video recording hardware for conferences, meetings and user groups worldwide.\n\n**Find out more about HDMI2USB and why we're doing this in [ABOUT + FAQ](https://hdmi2usb.tv/faq/)**",

The page will eventually take you to our [getting started issue tracker](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues) which includes our most fleshed out ideas for projects, many of which are suitable for GSoC.\n\nWe encourage students to figure out which idea excites them the most! A student who is interested in their project is more likely to write a good proposal and get accepted. As selecting a project or understanding an idea can be hard, we recommend you come join us [on IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=timvideos) and talk to us further about them. Good students are engaged with the community before GSoC even starts!\n\nOnce you have found a project you are interested in working on, go to the issue tracker for the project and look for bugs marked \"Good First Bug\". These bugs are simple enough that you should with some help be able try to fix them. Submitting a bug fix shows that you have understood the project enough to get things set up and while **not** required is a strong positive signal we will use when assessing your application.\n\nAs mentioned in the [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) page, mentors and the community are happy to review applications and give feedback. This will drastically improve the quality of your application and give you a better chance of being accepted.",

While we are funded nationally, our users are international, with only 40% of our traffic coming from within the United States. Last month we had over 3,500 users. We are committed to open-source software from the beginning and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our [static interval tree](http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree), [KM statistics](http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier) and [ICGC plugin](http://xena.ucsc.edu/integration-icgc-portal/)). \n\nStudents we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger [UCSC Genomics Institute]( https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease. We are committed to working with students to ensure that they gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and useful code to the project. \n\nWe are interested in finding long-term collaborators and growing our development team.

They don't really use the default toolchains on Windows or macOS, but a simple *nix like ./configure && make doesn't really do the trick either. We have plenty of information available on this wiki and we will happily provide help on our IRC channel.\n## Provide a small patch\nTo demonstrate your skills, share a small patch with us. This will let you become familiar with Git, in case you don't know it already and our process on merging patches.\n## Let's get in touch\nWe have 3 major communication channels at VideoLAN. Our mailing-lists to discuss patches and further development related topics. Furthermore, we have our web forums for end-user support. Finally, there are our IRC channels _#vlmc_  and _#videolan_ on the Freenode network. They are open to any kind of discussion. Usage issues, questions how to compile VLMC, getting to know the fellow developers, etc.",

ViSP was designed to be independent from the hardware, to be simple to use, expandable and cross-platform. ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.\n\nReleases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip. ViSP is also packaged as binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, OSX, iOS, and for ROS framework.\n\nThe user site is at https://visp.inria.fr/. The developer site is at: https://github.com/lagadic/visp/wiki. Nightly builds of the documentation are at: http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/. Code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/lagadic/visp. Inspired from OpenCV we also propose visp_contrib (new algorithms, applications and future GSoC contributions, related tutorials and samples code): https://github.com/lagadic/visp_contrib.git. Downloads for various OS and mobile devices: https://visp.inria.fr/download/. More than 50 tutorials are available to help the user: http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/index.html#tutorial.",

On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers.

It should not be overly detailed .\n* How will I achieve this: Explain how the project will be done, what technologies are needed and how to implement them.\n* What will the project focus on: Explain what the project will focus on, what is the important parts of the project.\n* Benefits: Who will benefit and why from this project. Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.\n* Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.\n* What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.\n* Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge what hardware etc.\n* Possible mentors: Place to add possible mentors (Team-Kodi will add this).",

      "description": "# Why Open Science?\nScience is only at its finest when its fruits are accessible to anyone in the world, when the data is publicly available to support the claims in the paper, and when the software is treated as first-class citizen in the scientific publishing, so that the results can be analyzed, reproduced and refined by anyone, today and 5, 10 or 100 years in the future. Principles of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) are at the core of the scientific method.\n\nMost of the scholarly communication today is done as it was a hundred years ago. The data supporting the claims in the paper can be difficult to acquire or even impossible to find, software used to produce the results is a collection of scripts rotting-away on a laptop or a USB stick, while the paper itself, after it's been published, is kept behind a publisher's paywall, and is not easily accessible to everyone. The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.\n\n# What is Zenodo?\nZenodo is an open and free digital archive, allowing all researchers from around the world to publish their papers, data and software, which then can be cited, accessed, analyzed and reproduced by anyone. Zenodo is built by the researchers and software engineers at [CERN](http://home.cern/) in collaboration with [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/), sharing passion for Open Source and Open Science. Zenodo is both a free and public [service](https://zenodo.org), as well as Free and Open Source [Software](http://zenodo.readthedocs.io), based on [Invenio](http://invenio.readthedocs.io) - a general purpose digital library platform, and also a FOSS developed and used by CERN as well as other institutions worldwide. By contributing to Zenodo you will also contribute to Invenio, so not only will you aid Open Science, but also many other scientific institutes and academic libraries around the world!\n\n[1] The name, Zenodo, is derived from [Zenodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus), the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.",

Zulip also supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, audible notifications, missed-message emails, desktop apps, and [much more](https://www.zulip.org).\n\nZulip has gained a considerable amount of traction [since Dropbox released it as open source software in September 2015](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/open-sourcing-zulip-a-dropbox-hack-week-project/), and is gaining more users at a rapid pace -- every day, at least tens of thousands of people use Zulip. Your work on Zulip will have impact on the daily experiences of a huge number of people.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and making sure our product quality is extremely high -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Since Zulip is a group chat product, your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (often collaborating with developers over chat to solve tricky problems), with a real focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",
