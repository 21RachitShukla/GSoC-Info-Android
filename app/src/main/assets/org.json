         "description":"[52°North](http://52north.org) is an international research and development partner network with partners from academia, the public sector and industry. Our goal is to foster innovation in the field of geoinformatics by organizing and facilitating a collaborative software development process. The topics we address comprise for example sensor web technologies, web-based geoprocessing the web of things, linked open data, spatial data infrastructures, citizen science, earth observation, and 3D. This selection of topics reflects both the strengths and strategies of the partners involved.\n\nSome of our software projects are enviroCar, 52°North SOS, 52°North Helgoland (JavaScript Sensor Web Client), ILWIS, and 52°North WPS. Check out our GitHub organization and our Open Hub page to learn more about the wide range of software our communities work on: from mobile apps to standardized web services, from cutting edge research to established products. 52°North open source projects are used in a broad range of domains (e.g. oceanology, air quality, hydrology, traffic planning) and operational as well as research projects (e.g. European Horizon 2020 projects such as NeXOS, FixO3, ConnectinGEO, WaterInnEU, ODIP 2, SeaDataCloud).\n\nAll of the 52°North software is published under an OSI approved open source license.\n\n52°North GmbH, which is the legal body and service center of the network, acts as a non-profit organization. This means that the shareholders of 52°North do not receive profit shares or payments from company funds. Instead, the profits earned by 52°North are completely re-invested into the innovation and software development process.",

The server management  is done through a friendly user interface (the \"platform”). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.\n\nThe installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR \"engine\") and some are very popular open source apps and services.",

We will evaluate student applications solely on the basis of programming skills, academic merit and the feasibility of the proposals. \n\nIf you are a prospective student interested in doing your Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project with us, please contact us as soon as possible. We will do our best to assist and guide you in the formulation of your GSoC project proposal.",

Here are the main tips to help you when writing your GSOC application with Apertium.\r\n\r\n- Be realistic: We're more likely to accept realistic ideas than far-out wacky ones. But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page! If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Paradigm\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine’s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.",

         "description":"Babel helps you write the latest version of JavaScript, and is helping shape the future of the language itself. It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and hundreds of other [companies](http://babeljs.io/users). It's downloaded more than [8 million times a month](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core) on npm.\n\nWhen your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.\n\nIn short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.\n\n### Transition to Natively Support JavaScript\n\nBabel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.\n\nFor example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 2); // arrow functions!\n```\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(function (a) { // compiled to a regular function expression\n  return a+2;\n});\n```\n\nEfforts like https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env means you can take advantage of the native browser support when possible.\n\nPlease read the tips below on how to get started and how to create a successful proposal!",

If you don't have experience with it, we strongly suggest using it in a project before applying, otherwise you won't understand the context behind the decisions we make (why does this project need to exist and continue to exist). I believe we would favor those with more experience with the tool itself (and understand it's issues) rather than someone that hasn't used it before but just knows about compliers\n- Any code change (other than maybe the website) will require extensive tests and documentation, so you'll need to know how to write unit tests as well as explain what you project is doing for the user\n- Have a Slack account (explained below) to communicate with the mentors/community\n\n## Before applying, you should\n- Read our guide: https://github.com/babel/babel/wiki/GSoC-Application-Guide\n- Join our [Slack](http://slack.babeljs.io/) and say hi in our [#summer-of-code](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/summer-of-code) channel if you have questions!\n- Follow us on twitter: [@babeljs](https://twitter.com/babeljs)\n- Star/Watch our main github repo: https://github.com/babel/babel\n- Check out our [docs website](https://babeljs.io/) and play around with our [REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=false&lineWrap=false&presets=env&targets=&browsers=&builtIns=true&code=var%20name%20%3D%20%22Bob%22%2C%20time%20%3D%20%22today%22%3B%0A%60Hello%20%24%7Bname%7D%2C%20how%20are%20you%20%24%7Btime%7D%3F%60&experimental=true&loose=true&spec=true&playground=false&stage=0)\n- Read through [babel-handbook](https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/README.md)",

         "description":"# The IDEs of Python\nPython has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.",

[You may find this searchable archive of boost-dev useful](http://boost.2283326.n4.nabble.com/Boost-Dev-f2600599.html).\n2.

Read [the Boost Discussion Policy](http://www.boost.org/community/policy.html) in full, and once read in full go to  http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost and subscribe.\n3. After as an absolute minimum reading all posts tagged **[gsoc16]**, students should write a well researched and intelligent message with **[gsoc16]** at the front of the subject line to that developer's mailing list seeking a mentor, and be as flexible as possible in finding a topic that both they and the mentor is interested in upon which to base a GSoC project proposal text to be submitted to Google.\n As a general rule, a well written and researched proposal to extend or improve an existing mature Boost library is likely to be much better received that student originated ideas for new libraries or facilities.\n4.

         "description":"Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach our ultimate goal, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networking. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system, which we expect to deploy in production by the end of 2017. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nOur previous GSoC students have taken advantage of the advanced knowledge they acquired to go on to graduate schools, to become some of our GSoC mentors, and to continue supporting free software. Pursuing GSoC with the Linux XIA team at BU could be a great way for you to acquire advanced skills and build connections towards a strong application to the Masters or Ph.D. program at the Computer Science department of Boston University.\n\nThe projects in our ideas list cater to students who are proficient in C programming and comfortable with advanced data structures.",

         "description":"The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.",

         "description":"# What is cBioPortal?\nThe cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is a resource designed to provide broad community access to cancer genomic data. It provides a unique user\u00ad-friendly and \"biology\u00ad-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\n# Who is using cBioPortal? \nThe [public instance of cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 3,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal ([Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract) & [Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210)) have been cited more than 1,900 and 1,400 times, respectively, since their publication. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe. Notably, cBioPortal has been adopted as the analysis and visualization platform by [AACR GENIE](http://blog.aacr.org/aacr-project-genie-the-sharing-economy-comes-to-the-clinic/), an international multi-institutional data-sharing project to catalyze precision oncology. \n\n# Who are we?\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/), [the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/), [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/), [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](http://www.chop.edu/), and [The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands](http://thehyve.nl/).",

There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. \nIf you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. \nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps.\nWe also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.",

         "description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.\nWe have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the\n[Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time,\nbefore they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of\n_pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count =\n\"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html#get-started).",

         "description":"Due to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs.\n\nWe have developed the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it will revolutionize the study of the ancient world. It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500). As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.",

What follows is a high–level overview of these projects and a few tips in applying. Most work will be done in the Python and JavaScript languages, of which a beginner's or intermediate knowledge is expected.\n\nIf you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See the Projects page on the wiki for ideas of what a good application will include. See also [the CLTK docs](http://docs.cltk.org) for what we can already do for a given language.\n\nThe other family of tasks regards the CLTK's in–development website, the Classical Language Archive ([in Meteor and React](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_frontend)) and API ([in Python's Flask framework](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_api_v2)). See our description of the frontend, experiment with the live demo, and explain in your application which functionality you would most like to see added, why, and how you will do so over the course of three months.\n\nThe CLTK's GSoC mentors may not be able to reply to all enquiries, however the best way to ensure a good response is to submit, as early as possible, a draft application essay, in which you explain the resources you will use, the order in which you will do your work, and a timeline.

The (2) psycholinguists research the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on the (3) computational linguistics subgroup.\n\nCurrent research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of  personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.\n\nOver the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.",

         "precis":"CloudCV is a young open source platform to make AI research reproducible by making it easy for researchers to build, compare and share state-of-the-art AI algorithms with everyone.",
         "description":"CloudCV is a young open source cloud platform  started in 2013 by students and faculty from Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Virginia Tech (now at Georgia Tech) with the aim to make AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis.",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

         "description":"Conversations.im originally started out as an easy to use Jabber/XMPP client for the Android platform specifically targeted at end users and people who are new to XMPP. To achieve this end, a big priority of the project is great UX. Being an XMPP client, Conversations aims to be fully compatible with XMPP clients on other platforms such as Gajim on Window & Linux as well as ChatSecure on iOS.\n\nThe Conversations project is very involved in driving progress in the XMPP-based instant messaging sphere. We make use of bleeding-edge protocol extensions where available, but more than that, we are also actively developing novel approaches to yet unsolved problems. We are not afraid to try new things and our active community is always willing to try out prototype implementations. Furthermore, members of the Conversations team are also part of the XMPP Standards Foundation to standardize newly developed approaches for modern, mobile friendly XMPP.\nOne very successful example of such innovation is OMEMO encryption, which is now supported by 5+ popular XMPP clients and was originally developed for Conversations as a GSoC project.\n\nOver time, the Conversations project also developed various tools to make life easier for end users and also make the XMPP world more approachable for new comers. For example we developed the XMPP Compliance Tester that tests public servers for compatibility with the latest XMPP extensions to help users [pick a good server](https://gultsch.de/compliance_ranked.html).",

It is interlinked to many other datasets. The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called *Linked Data*, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.\n\n# The Web of data\nSuch *Web of data* provides useful knowledge that can complement the *Web of documents* in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010 website* by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *disambiguation*). For example, `Washington` can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.\n\n# We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

It works as:\n\n- a mailing list\n- a discussion forum\n- a long-form chat room\n\n### What’s different about it?\n\nDiscourse is a from-scratch reboot, an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion platform should be today, in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\n### We’re civilized.\n\nOur unique \"trust levels\" system means that the community builds a natural immune system to defend itself from trolls, bad actors, and spammers — and the most engaged community members can assist in the governance of their community. We put a trash can on every street corner with a simple, low-friction flagging system. Positive behaviors are encouraged through likes and badges. We gently, constantly educate members in a just-in-time manner on the universal rules of civilized discourse.\n\n### Uncompromisingly open source.\n\nThere is only one version of Discourse – the awesome open source version. There’s no super secret special paid commercial version with better or more complete features. Because Discourse is 100% open source, now and forever, it belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. That’s how community works.\n\nEverything that most communities would want is included out of the box; a giant collection of complex plugins should not be required to have a great experience.\n\n### Further reading:\n\n- https://www.discourse.org/faq/\n- http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/\n- https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/\n- https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/\n- https://meta.discourse.org/",

         "description":"Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.",

         "description":"Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.\n\nThe overall goal is to combine:\n\n  - A devotion to communication, design, and user experience.\n  - Strong theoretical foundations.\n\nExamples of these goals in practice include the following.\n\n\n# No Runtime Exceptions\n\nUnlike hand-written JavaScript, Elm code does not produce runtime exceptions in practice. Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give [friendly hints](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants). This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 90k+ lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.\n\n# Great Performance\n\nElm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and [the benchmarks](http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two) show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.\n\n# Enforced Semantic Versioning\n\nElm can detect all API changes automatically thanks to its type system. We use that information to force everything in [our package catalog](http://package.elm-lang.org) to follow [semantic versioning](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/#version-rules) precisely. No more surprises in PATCH releases!",

For example:\n\n  - Optimizations like monomorphization and escape analysis\n  - Editor tooling like [elmjutsu](https://atom.io/packages/elmjutsu)\n  - Pushing the state of WebGL in Elm\n\nYou can spend a whole career in each of these topics, and there are significant technical and conceptual challenges for beginners and experts alike. The documentation generated alone will be extremely valuable!\n\n\n# Details\n\nYou should share the following information:\n\n  - What have you done with Elm? How are you involved with the community?\n  - What general project categories are you most interested in?\n  - Why are you interested in those categories?\n  - Outline (at a high level) one or two specific projects that you would be excited to work on.\n\nYou can also optionally share:\n\n  - Personal Projects, not necessarily related to what you want to learn right now!\n  - Writing samples: blog posts, github issue, mailing list exchanges, etc.\n\nDo not worry if you skip these. Part of the goal of this program is to build these skills!",

         "description":"**Open Monitoring, Documenting, and Responding to the Removal of Environmental Data**\n\nThe Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) leverages research and online tools to monitor, document, and respond to the anticipated undermining of evidence-based environmental governance. EDGI is committed to tracking changes to US federal environmental management and governance, in a range of agencies including EPA, NOAA, NASA, USGS, OSHA, DoE and BLM, among many others.\n\nEDGI brings together North American social scientists, environmental and physical scientists, lawyers, and other information and environmental professionals to document and advocate for the vital importance of evidence-based environmental policy. Through three core working groups EDGI analyzes changes to federal agencies' 1) funding and regulation, 2) personnel and research and 3) **public data**.\n\nThrough the third working group, EDGI has been a leading partner in the international effort to preserve and track federal environmental data, and support environmental scientists, non-profit organizations, and foundations by making this data publicly available. We are also indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work. We need deep thinkers to develop protocols for the resilient, sustainable, accessible, distributed data storage networks of the future; machine learning experts to sift through millions of web pages to find the most important changes; and security specialists to protect the privacy of our volunteers and ensure the integrity of our data. We believe this work is essential to preserving the integrity of scientific research in the US, and also builds a new level of transparency and government accountability to citizens.",
